Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high.
Glucose comes from the foods you eat.
Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy.
With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well.
