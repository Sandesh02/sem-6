Sinusitis is generally triggered by a viral upper respiratory tract infection, with only 2% of cases being complicated by bacterial sinusitis.2 About 90% of patients in the United States are estimated to receive an antibiotic from their general practitioner, yet in most cases the condition resolves without antibiotics, even if it is bacterial in origin.3 Most general practitioners rely on clinical findings to make the diagnosis. Signs and symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis and those of a prolonged viral upper respiratory tract infection are closely similar, resulting in frequent misclassification of viral cases as bacterial sinusitis.
